The values in slope_vector (see c_estimation.m) are approximately equal to 1. Hence, we can say C ~ 1 (that is, C is approximately 1). So the convergence is linear. 

Since K is a symmetric matrix exact convergence is O(|lambda_2/lambda_1|^2m) where m is the max number of iterations. Since the eigenvalues are exact m = 1. So the expected convergence rate is exp(|lambda_2/lambda_1|^2) = exp((0.4675)^2) = exp(0.2186) = 1.224. That is, it is close to our estimate C.

b) The eigenfunctions flip back and forth since the approximation alternates between same negative and positive version of an eigenvector. 

d) No. This iteration converges fairly quickly.
